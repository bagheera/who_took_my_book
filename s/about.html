                    <h3>Who took my book?</h3>
                <p>
                    This application is meant to encourage sharing of books without worrying about losing them. I'd appreciate your <a href="http://github.com/bagheera/who_took_my_book/issues">feedback</a>
                    on bugs/features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works...
                </p>
                <p>
                    To borrow a book you are interested in, simply click borrow. The app then sends an email to both book owner and borrower. The owner is then expected to lend the book. 
                    'Borrow' can also be used 'after-the-fact' to record that you have borrowed a book from someone (although I'd expect the owner to hit 'lend' in this case).  
                    Note that lenders and borrowers need to know each other by their nicknames registered with the app. 
                </p>
				<p>
					It is also now possible to lend books to users who aren't registered with this app. Just so that you can keep track of who you are lending to.

                    For the technically inclined...
                </p>
                <p>
                    It runs on the Google Appengine (Python). 
                    I wrote it to get a feel of writing apps for the appengine. Till the number of books becomes large (say 1000+), I intend to display all books on the landing page. 
                    If you are a RESTafarian, you might cringe that I tunnel all sort of actions via GET (as yet). I am guilty as charged but my priorities for this app were elsewhere.
