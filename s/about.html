<p>This application is meant to encourage sharing books without fear of losing them. I would appreciate your <a href="http://github.com/bagheera/who_took_my_book/issues">feedback</a> on bugs/features.</p>
<p>How it works...<br/>
Click on borrow to record that you have already borrowed a book or you want to borrow. The app then sends an email to both book owner and borrower.  
Note that the borrower needs to know who the owner is by the google id (nickname support planned). 
</p>
<p>For the technically inclined...<br/> It runs on the Google Appengine (Python). 
I wrote it to get a feel of writing apps for the appengine. Till the number of books becomes large (say 1000+), I intend to display all books on the landing page. 
If you are a RESTafarian, you might cringe that I tunnel all sort of actions via GET. I am guilty as charged but my priorities for this app were elsewhere.
